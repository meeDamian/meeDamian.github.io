<h6>[Intro]</h6>
I don't smile, I don't frown, get too up or get too down (Nah)<br/>
I was here, so were you, you came and went, I stuck around (Yeah)<br/>
Still here now, stop me how? Your opinion's like a broken calculator<br/>
That shit doesn't count<br/>
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth<br/>
</p>

<p>
<h6>[Chorus]</h6>
I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)<br>
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had<br>
I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)<br>
Get 'em all off my pad (Yeah), every thought that I had (I'm eastside)<br>
</p>

Haven't used

<mark class="red">my</mark>
<mark class="pink">bag</mark>
<sup><i>(My bag)</i></sup>
<br>

Get a
<mark class="green">lit</mark><mark class="gray">tle</mark>
<mark class="pink">tes</mark><mark class="green">te</mark> when
<mark class="red">I'm</mark>
<mark class="pink">mad</mark> <sup><i>(I'm mad)</i></sup>,

<mark class="red">might</mark>
<mark class="pink">add</mark>
<sup><i>(Might add)</i></sup>
<br>

And I know it's
<mark class="pink">best</mark>
<mark class="gray">to</mark> leave
<mark class="green">it</mark>
<mark class="red">lie</mark>
<br>

<br>

But I need to get off the
<mark class="green">in</mark><mark class="gray">ter</mark><mark class="pink">net</mark>
<sup><i>(Get off the internet)</i></sup>
<br>

I need to get on the mic (Get on the mic)
<br>

You need to get off the internet (Internet)
<br>

You need to get you a life
<br>

Why you waste time just to comment on shit? (Comment on shit)<br>
Especially shit you don't like (Shit you don't like)<br>
Don't like it, don't listen, but don't tell me 'bout your favorite rapper rippin' some shit he didn't write (Shit he didn't write)
<br>
What happened to Slim? He was no cap with the pen<br>
He used to rap like the people his music was for<br>
He was exactly like them<br>
The dude who used to be poor, why can't he tap into him?<br>
Can't use that excuse anymore<br>
He's mad at the wind, he's in a nuclear war<br>
With a cloud, he's yellin' at it again<br>
I talked to your mother, she told me she loved me<br>
All she wanna do is just hold me and hug me<br>
Wants nobody but me, she showed me the Dougie<br>
Can I get a witness like notary public? (Preach)<br>
She said, "Kick some fly shit" (Fly shit)<br>
I said, "I got wings on my ass" (Wings on my ass)<br>
Told her my dick's a cockpit (Dick's a cockpit)<br>
I fly by the seat of my pants (Seat of my pants)<br>
Sinful thoughts, this beat is crazy, this shit's retarded<br>
This instru's mental (This instru's mental) to mini-bars, incidental charges<br>
When did it start? I been cold-hearted in this heart since kindergarten<br>
Mental sharpness which makes Slim a walking dentist office, bitch, I invented flossin'<br>
Yeah, I used to wonder (I used to wonder) where my next meal's gonna come from (Meal's gonna come from)<br>
Now, I just wonder (Now I just wonder) where my next mill's gonna come from (Mill's gonna come from)<br>
I cannot have no success (Have no success), unless when I finally make it (Finally make it)<br>
I get to remind all the haters (Remind all the haters) who shitted on me when I'm on my way up (I'm on my way)<br>
My floor is y'all fool's ceilings<br>
If I was you, I would step or find yourself twisted<br>
That's how you'll wind up like spiral stairs<br>
I will swear on a stack of Bibles<br>
I will tear new behinds out of rivals, even your idols, I don't care<br>
It's Music to Be Murdered By, so Bon Iver can swallow a fuckin' Ja Rule bobblehead<br>
And die slow like Alzheimer's (Ha-ha)<br>
Lone sniper, I hold a microphone like a loaded rifle<br>
My dome's brighter, all I spit from my skull's fire<br>
All that's missing's a motorcycle with the chrome wires, spoke tires<br>
And y'all are flow biters, so I don't gotta<br>
Explain why they call me your ghostwriter<br>
</p>

<p>
<h6>[Chorus]</h6>
I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)<br>
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had<br>
I said I'm emptyin' (I'm emptyin') my book of rhymes (My book of rhymes)<br>
Get 'em all off my pad, every thought that I had (Illa)<br>
</p>

<p>
<h6>[Verse 2]</h6>
Haven't used all the tricks I have, so like my balls, it's in my bag<br>
I tend to get a little testy when I'm mad<br>
But gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems<br>
Put lips to ass and kiss the cracks, spit your damnedest<br>
You're still gonna hit the canvas<br>
Rippin' rappers, veterans to whippersnappers<br>
Mr. Mathers is killin' this shit, villainous wit with scant less<br>
Syllables rip the planet, biblical shit's finna hit the fan<br>
Anybody wanna go tit for tat's gonna get hit with that<br>
Then the amygdala hippocampus is gonna trigger the ignoramus<br>
To think of the most ridiculous shit to spit then<br>
Pit it against these pitiful rappers<br>
Insidious, these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as MC Hammer's<br>
Get your whole squad, send a task force in<br>
If you want it, you're 'bout to get what you asked for then<br>
Put your helmet on, strap your chin<br>
You're 'bout to get you a crash course in<br>
Who not to start a motherfuckin' rap war with<br>
Or to go against, fuck would you wanna do that for?<br>
No offense, but are you retards slow or dense?<br>
A fuckin' penny has more sense<br>
Yeah, now you gotta get killed, but it's not a big deal, but every thought is so ill<br>
And so methodical, thought I swallowed a pill<br>
I'm starting to feel like I'm an automobile<br>
With Barnacle Bill inside the car at the wheel<br>
Inside a carnival, 'cause I'm plowin' into everyone who wrote snidey articles<br>
And that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill<br>
Joy and pain, fortune, fame, torture, shame, choice I made<br>
Swore someday the world would pay less to lose, more to gain, daughters raised<br>
Yesterday, glory days, adored and praised, ignored the hate<br>
Addressed the fake, toured with Dre, tore a page from Jordan came<br>
Destroyed the game before you came, enjoy your stay<br>
Before it's gone away, but the more you claim that you're gonna point and aim<br>
If it joined a gang, your shit isn't going to bang<br>
You're just boring, lame and more of the same<br>
You have an enormous chain, but a stormless brain<br>
The most you can form is rain<br>
Your shit is pointless, same as a scoreless game<br>
So, bitch, quit lyin', you're denyin' like Mr. Porter's name (Haha)<br>
Borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller<br>
Eyes rollin' back in my skull like Eli Porter<br>
Fire mortar (Brr) rounds, Ayatollah, every iota I load up<br>
I owe to my motor mouth<br>
This is my note to self<br>
Sometimes you're gonna bomb<br>
So you just might have to blow yourself up with no one's help<br>
I just wrote it down in my book of rhymes<br>
Preemo, take us out<br>
</p>

<p>
<H6>[Outro]</H6>
Writin' in my book of rhymes<br>
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes<br>
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside<br>
Writin' in my book of rhymes<br>
My book of rhymes, my book of rhymes<br>
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm eastside
</p>
